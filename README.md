# Customize_Blog_In_Django

## <a href="http://fdjblog.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">See Live Demo</a>

It is a Blog Project. It's a fully customize Blog application in which I have created a good-looking Header and Footer. This blog has a navigation bar, in which it has an about us page and a privacy policy page.
In this blog application, I have used the CRUD function. In this blog application, I have also created page pagination. It also has a sidebar. Every particular blog post has a comment section.

Aim: This project aims to create a fully customized blog that can be used to spread the words of the creator around the world. And can be used by the user easily.
